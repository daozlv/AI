In order to facilitate debugging, the method of calling main function is changed. The path of train_img_fname,
train_txt_fname and test_img_fname files are given directly.You can run this py file directly for debugging.


There are 26 uppercase Latin characters, 26 lowercase characters, 10 numbers, spaces and 7 punctuation marks, (), -! "?" So set the hidden state of HMM to N = 69.
In terms of emission probability, we use a simple naive Bayesian classifier, so B is a unit matrix. The number of black
dots is calculated after each letter image is segmented to represent the observed value, which also has M = 69 observed values.
Read the text data in Part1 as text. txt. Calculate the parameters of pi, A and B, and establish the HMM model.

After the completion of the initial modeling, the effect is not satisfactory. The main reasons are as follows: 1.
The improper selection of features leads to one observation value corresponding to several states. 2. The model needs to be optimized.

Improvement: Change the way of calculating the eigenvalues, and take the points on the crossing of the letters as the eigenvalues.
The effect is worse after modeling.

Finally, the sum of points and all 0 points on the crossing is used as the feature to model, eliminating the situation that one
feature corresponds to several hidden states. Because of the interference of white points, the final test results are complemented
to the ideal. The next step is to prepare for image filtering (denoising direction is enhanced).
